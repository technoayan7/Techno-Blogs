# 🏭 Factory Design Pattern in Java

The **Factory Design Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** used to create objects **without exposing the creation logic** to the client.

Instead of using `new` keyword directly, we **delegate the object creation** to a factory method.

---

## 🎯 Real-Life Analogy

🧃 Imagine ordering a drink at a juice shop.

You don't care how the juice is made – you just say "Give me an **Orange Juice**", and the shop handles the rest.

Similarly, with the Factory Pattern, the **factory class creates the object** based on your input.

---

## 🔧 When to Use It?

* When the **object creation logic is complex** or depends on conditions.
* When you want to **centralize creation** logic.
* When you need **loose coupling** between classes.

## 🔥 Basic Example – Shape Factory

### 🔸 Step 1: Create a common interface

```java
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}
```

---

### 🔸 Step 2: Implement different shapes

```java
class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

class Square implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Square");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔸 Step 3: Create a Factory class

```java
class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType == null) return null;

        if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("SQUARE")) {
            return new Square();
        }

        return null;
    }
}
```

---

### 🔸 Step 4: Use Factory in Main Class

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShapeFactory factory = new ShapeFactory();

        Shape shape1 = factory.getShape("CIRCLE");
        shape1.draw();

        Shape shape2 = factory.getShape("SQUARE");
        shape2.draw();
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Output

```
Drawing a Circle  
Drawing a Square
```

## 📌 Key Concepts

| Concept               | Description                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Loose Coupling        | Client doesn’t care how objects are created       |
| Reusability           | Easy to manage and extend object creation         |
| Encapsulation         | Hides object instantiation logic                  |
| Open/Closed Principle | Easy to add new shapes without modifying old code |

## 🧠 Real-World Use Case: Notification Service

Suppose your app supports notifications via Email and SMS. The client should just say “Send Notification” — the factory decides how.

---

### 🔸 Step 1: Notification Interface

```java
interface Notification {
    void notifyUser();
}
```

---

### 🔸 Step 2: Implementations

```java
class EmailNotification implements Notification {
    public void notifyUser() {
        System.out.println("Sending Email Notification");
    }
}

class SMSNotification implements Notification {
    public void notifyUser() {
        System.out.println("Sending SMS Notification");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔸 Step 3: Factory Class

```java
class NotificationFactory {
    public Notification createNotification(String type) {
        if (type == null || type.isEmpty()) return null;

        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("EMAIL")) {
            return new EmailNotification();
        } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("SMS")) {
            return new SMSNotification();
        }

        return null;
    }
}
```

---

### 🔸 Step 4: Main Class

```java
public class NotificationService {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NotificationFactory factory = new NotificationFactory();

        Notification email = factory.createNotification("EMAIL");
        email.notifyUser();

        Notification sms = factory.createNotification("SMS");
        sms.notifyUser();
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Output

```
Sending Email Notification  
Sending SMS Notification
```

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

* ❌ Huge `if-else` chains in factory → use **enum or config** to clean it later.
* ❌ Mixing business logic inside factory → keep factory focused on **object creation** only.

---

## 🧠 Interview Q\&A

**Q:** What pattern category does Factory belong to?
**A:** Creational

**Q:** What's the difference between Factory and Abstract Factory?
**A:**

* **Factory** → returns one family/type of object.
* **Abstract Factory** → returns **related objects** from multiple factories.

**Q:** Why not just use `new`?
**A:** Because `new` tightly couples the client with the implementation. Factory gives you **flexibility and control**.

---

## 📚 Summary

* ✅ Factory Pattern helps in creating objects in a clean and controlled way.
* 🧱 Promotes **loose coupling**, **reusability**, and **maintainability**.
* 📦 Useful when object creation is **conditional**, **dynamic**, or **complex**.
