To enable syntax highlighting for multiple languages like C++, JavaScript, ReactJS, Python, HTML, and CSS, you can follow the steps below. PrismJS supports many languages out-of-the-box, but you need to import the corresponding language components for PrismJS to highlight the code correctly.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
greet();
```

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")
greet()
```

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

### 4. **Ensure Proper Highlighting**:

With these imports and configuration, your code blocks should now be highlighted properly in the blog with support for multiple languages.
