# 🧩 Decorator Design Pattern in Java

The **Decorator Pattern** is a **structural design pattern** that allows you to **add new behavior** to an object **without modifying its code**.

---

## 🍕 Real-Life Analogy

Think of a pizza shop:

* Base pizza = plain
* You can **add cheese**, **veggies**, or **paneer** without modifying the original pizza.

This is what **Decorator Pattern** does: it wraps an object to add new behavior.

---

## 🎯 When to Use It?

* When you want to **add features to objects at runtime**.
* When using inheritance would lead to a large number of subclasses.
* When you need to follow the **Open/Closed Principle** (Open for extension, Closed for modification).

## 🔧 Example – Pizza Toppings

Let’s build a system where we can decorate a basic pizza with toppings.

---

### 🔸 Step 1: Create a Base Interface

```java
public interface Pizza {
    String getDescription();
    double getCost();
}
```

---

### 🔸 Step 2: Concrete Component

```java
public class Margherita implements Pizza {
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Margherita";
    }

    public double getCost() {
        return 100.0;
    }
}
```

---

### 🔸 Step 3: Abstract Decorator

```java
public abstract class ToppingDecorator implements Pizza {
    protected Pizza pizza;

    public ToppingDecorator(Pizza pizza) {
        this.pizza = pizza;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return pizza.getDescription();
    }

    public double getCost() {
        return pizza.getCost();
    }
}
```

---

### 🔸 Step 4: Concrete Decorators (Toppings)

```java
public class Cheese extends ToppingDecorator {
    public Cheese(Pizza pizza) {
        super(pizza);
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return super.getDescription() + ", Cheese";
    }

    public double getCost() {
        return super.getCost() + 30.0;
    }
}

public class Olives extends ToppingDecorator {
    public Olives(Pizza pizza) {
        super(pizza);
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return super.getDescription() + ", Olives";
    }

    public double getCost() {
        return super.getCost() + 20.0;
    }
}
```

---

### 🔸 Step 5: Test the Pizza Builder

```java
public class DecoratorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pizza pizza = new Margherita();
        pizza = new Cheese(pizza);
        pizza = new Olives(pizza);

        System.out.println("Pizza: " + pizza.getDescription());
        System.out.println("Total Cost: ₹" + pizza.getCost());
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Output

```
Pizza: Margherita, Cheese, Olives  
Total Cost: ₹150.0
```

## 📌 Key Concepts

| Concept           | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Component         | Base interface or class (e.g., Pizza)                  |
| ConcreteComponent | Actual implementation (e.g., Margherita)               |
| Decorator         | Wraps component to add behavior (e.g., Cheese, Olives) |

---

## 🔁 Real-World Use Cases

* ✅ Java I/O streams: `BufferedInputStream`, `DataInputStream`
* ✅ Spring Security Filters
* ✅ UI frameworks (adding scrollbars, borders to components)
* ✅ Logging enhancements

---

## 🧠 Interview Q\&A

**Q:** What type of pattern is Decorator?
**A:** Structural

**Q:** What's the difference between Decorator and Inheritance?
**A:**

* **Inheritance** is compile-time and static
* **Decorator** is runtime and flexible

**Q:** Can we use multiple decorators?
**A:** Yes, decorators can be stacked/wrapped as many times as needed.

## 💡 Decorator vs Strategy vs Adapter

| Pattern   | Purpose                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| Decorator | Add responsibilities dynamically |
| Strategy  | Select algorithm at runtime      |
| Adapter   | Convert one interface to another |

---

## 🧠 SOLID Principle in Play

* **O – Open/Closed Principle:**
  Easily extend object behavior without modifying their code.

---

## 📚 Summary

* ✅ Decorator adds **new behavior** to objects without altering their structure.
* 🧱 Follows **composition over inheritance**.
* 🛠️ Helps write **flexible, reusable, and extensible code**.
* ⚙️ Used in Java libraries like I/O and GUI toolkits.
