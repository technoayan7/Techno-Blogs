# 📝 Notes: JWT and OAuth

## 🛡️ 1. JWT (JSON Web Token)

### 🔑 What is JWT?
JWT is a compact and self-contained way to represent information between two parties as a JSON object. It's commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications.

### 💡 How JWT Works:
- **Header**: Contains metadata about the token (e.g., signing algorithm).
- **Payload**: Contains claims, or the information you want to transmit (e.g., user info, permissions).
- **Signature**: Ensures the token has not been tampered with.

#### Example of JWT structure:
```
Header: 
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

Payload: 
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "role": "admin",
  "exp": "timestamp"
}

Signature: 
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```

### 🔑 JWT Example Code (Node.js):
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// Creating a JWT
const token = jwt.sign({ userId: 123, role: 'admin' }, 'your-secret-key', { expiresIn: '1h' });
console.log('JWT:', token);

// Verifying the JWT
jwt.verify(token, 'your-secret-key', (err, decoded) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Token is invalid or expired');
  } else {
    console.log('Decoded JWT:', decoded);
  }
});
```

### ✅ Advantages of JWT:
- **Stateless**: The server does not need to store session data.
- **Compact**: Smaller in size, thus reducing overhead.
- **Secure**: Can be encrypted and signed.

## 🔑 2. OAuth (Open Authorization)

### 🛠️ What is OAuth?
OAuth is an open standard for access delegation commonly used for token-based authentication and authorization in web applications. It allows users to grant third-party services limited access to their resources without sharing their credentials.

### 💡 How OAuth Works:
- **Authorization Code Grant**: The user authorizes the client to access their data.
- **Access Token**: The client gets an access token to access resources.
- **Refresh Token**: Used to get a new access token when the old one expires.

#### Example of OAuth flow:
1. **User** clicks on "Login with Google" on a website.
2. **Website** redirects to Google's OAuth server.
3. **User** grants permission to the website to access their Google profile.
4. **Google** redirects back with an authorization code.
5. **Website** exchanges the code for an access token and refresh token.
6. **Website** uses the access token to fetch data from the user's Google profile.

### 🔑 OAuth Example Code (Node.js with Passport.js):
```javascript
const passport = require('passport');
const GoogleStrategy = require('passport-google-oauth20').Strategy;

passport.use(new GoogleStrategy({
  clientID: 'your-client-id',
  clientSecret: 'your-client-secret',
  callbackURL: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback'
}, (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => {
  console.log('User Profile:', profile);
  return done(null, profile);
}));

// Express route for Google login
app.get('/auth/google', passport.authenticate('google', {
  scope: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login']
}));

// Google callback route
app.get('/auth/google/callback', passport.authenticate('google', { failureRedirect: '/' }), (req, res) => {
  res.redirect('/profile');
});
```

### ✅ Advantages of OAuth:
- **Delegated Access**: Users can share their data without revealing credentials.
- **Granular Permissions**: Clients can request limited access, rather than full access.
- **Secure**: Avoids sharing passwords by using tokens.

## 🤔 Difference Between JWT and OAuth

| Feature             | JWT                                             | OAuth                                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Authentication token format.                   | Authorization protocol.                        |
| **Usage**           | Used to authenticate users.                    | Used to authorize third-party access.          |
| **Token Type**      | Single token (JWT).                             | Access token and refresh token.                |
| **Stateful/Stateless** | Stateless (self-contained).                   | Can be stateful (requires a server-side session). |
| **Token Storage**   | Stored in localStorage, cookies, etc.           | Stored by authorization server.                |

## 📊 Conclusion:
- **JWT** is a compact, self-contained method for transmitting information between two parties.
- **OAuth** is a protocol for authorization that allows users to grant access to third-party services securely without sharing credentials.
